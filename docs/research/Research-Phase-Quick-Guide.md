# Research Phase Quick Guide

## Overview
Validate your ideas by gathering Hedera knowledge and resources. Set up tools like GitHub, Git, VS Code, and GitHub Copilot to fetch docs, SDKs, and examples locally. Use AI to explore code and understand feasibility without deep coding.

### Key Tools Setup
1. **GitHub Account**: For accessing repos ([github.com](https://github.com))
2. **Git**: Download repos ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
3. **VS Code**: Editor with AI support ([code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com))
4. **GitHub Copilot**: AI code assistant (extension in VS Code)

### Essential Resources to Fetch
- **Hedera SDKs**: Clone JS/Python SDKs for API understanding
- **AI Agent Kit**: Clone for natural language Hedera operations
- **MCP Servers**: For AI-Hedera integration

**Command Example:** `git clone https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js.git`

### Track-Specific Research
- **RWA**: Focus on Token Service for asset tokenization
- **Operations**: Consensus Service for data integrity
- **Gaming/NFTs**: NFT minting and collections
- **AI/DePIN**: AI Agent Kit and smart contracts

Use Copilot to query: "Explain Hedera token creation" or run examples locally.

## Tips for Non-Coders
- Start with your track's docs and clone 2-3 repos
- Use AI to summarize complex concepts
- Organize findings in notes.md
- Join [Hedera Discord](https://discord.gg/DzAbsm6T) for questions

## Next Steps
With resources ready, move to [Development](../development/) to build prototypes.

For additional research templates and long-form notes, keep them in this folder for easy editing.
