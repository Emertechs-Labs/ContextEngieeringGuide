# Ideation Phase Quick Guide

## Overview
The ideation phase is your creative starting point for the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Use AI tools to brainstorm innovative dApp ideas that solve real African challenges using Hedera's decentralized technology. No coding needed - focus on concepts that align with the four hackathon tracks.

### What You'll Do
- Generate project ideas using AI prompts
- Validate concepts against hackathon requirements
- Refine ideas for feasibility and impact

## Key AI Tools for Ideation
- **ChatGPT**: Conversational brainstorming ([chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/))
- **Claude**: Ethical AI for helpful responses ([claude.ai](https://claude.ai/))
- **Gemini**: Search-integrated ideation ([gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com/))

**Prompt Example:** "Generate 5 dApp ideas for tokenizing African farmland on Hedera, focusing on the RWA track."

## Hackathon Tracks Inspiration
- **Onchain Finance & RWA**: Tokenize assets, build lending platforms, create payment gateways
- **DLT for Operations**: Supply chain tracking, healthcare records, environmental monitoring
- **Immersive Experiences**: NFT marketplaces, play-to-earn games, virtual worlds
- **AI & DePIN**: Smart energy grids, decentralized internet, AI-powered logistics

## Tips for Non-Coders
- Start with problems you know from your community
- Use AI to refine rough ideas into solid concepts
- Document 3-5 ideas before moving to research
- Join [Hedera Discord](https://discord.gg/DzAbsm6T) for feedback

## Next Steps
Once you have ideas, proceed to [Research](../research/) to validate tech feasibility.
