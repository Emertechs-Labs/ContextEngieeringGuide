# Ideation Examples

This file contains example ideation outputs, prompts, and worksheets for the Hedera Africa Hackathon ideation phase.

## Example Project Ideas

### RWA Track: Farmland Tokenization
- **Problem**: African farmers lack access to credit due to lack of collateral.
- **Solution**: Tokenize farmland as NFTs on Hedera, allowing fractional ownership and lending.
- **Impact**: Increases farmer access to finance, improves supply chain transparency.

### Operations Track: Healthcare Supply Chain
- **Problem**: Counterfeit drugs in African markets.
- **Solution**: Use Hedera consensus service to track drug batches from manufacturer to pharmacy.
- **Impact**: Ensures drug authenticity, reduces health risks.

### Immersive Experiences Track: Cultural NFT Marketplace
- **Problem**: African artists struggle to monetize digital art.
- **Solution**: NFT marketplace on Hedera for African cultural artifacts and art.
- **Impact**: Empowers artists, preserves cultural heritage digitally.

### AI & DePIN Track: Smart Agriculture Grid
- **Problem**: Inefficient water usage in farming.
- **Solution**: AI-powered sensors on Hedera network for optimized irrigation.
- **Impact**: Reduces water waste, increases crop yields.
