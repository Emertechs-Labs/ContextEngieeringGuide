This repository collects the guides and templates used to build Hedera dApps for the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Long-form content lives inside `docs/` and the root README is an index for quick navigation.

## Table of contents

- Docs index — quick links to each phase (Ideation → Research → Development → Deployment → Submission)
- Quick start — short checklist to get moving
- Contributing — project contribution conventions (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)

## Docs index

- Deployment — [docs/deployment/Hedera-dApp-Deployment-Guide.md](docs/deployment/Hedera-dApp-Deployment-Guide.md)
- Development — [docs/development/README.md](docs/development/README.md)
- Ideation — [docs/ideation/README.md](docs/ideation/README.md)
- Research — [docs/research/README.md](docs/research/README.md)
- Submission — [docs/submission/README.md](docs/submission/README.md)

## Quick start

1. Pick a track and read the corresponding guides in `docs/`.
2. Follow the Development quick guide to scaffold a project and use the AI agent kits.
3. Use the Deployment guide to publish on Vercel/Render and integrate Hedera testnet.

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the repository conventions: keep long-form content inside `docs/`, keep root `README.md` as an index, and preferred file naming.
